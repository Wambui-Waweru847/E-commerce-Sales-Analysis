#### Introduction
The Ecommerce Sales Dashboard provides a comprehensive visual summary of key performance indicators (KPIs) that reflect the business performance of an online retail platform. It brings together vital metrics such as total orders, units sold, total revenue, sales trends, and customer preferences across various dimensions like country, product category, and payment method. This dashboard enables business stakeholders to make informed decisions by monitoring performance at a glance.

#### Problem Statement
With the growing scale of ecommerce operations, it becomes increasingly challenging to track sales activity, understand customer behavior, and identify underperforming segments. Business leaders need a reliable and real-time view of their operations to optimize marketing, improve inventory decisions, and increase customer satisfaction. The absence of such insights can lead to inefficiencies, missed opportunities, and reduced competitiveness in the digital marketplace.

#### Methodology
This analysis was conducted using a structured process involving:
- Data Cleaning: Ensuring consistency, removing duplicates, and correcting errors in the dataset.
- Data Visualization: Building an interactive Power BI dashboard that aggregates and displays the key sales metrics and trends.

#### Analysis Approach
The analysis was driven by key business questions:

- What are the total sales and order volume?

- Which products and markets are driving the most revenue?

- What are the dominant payment methods and their statuses?

- How do sales trends fluctuate across the year?
  
To answer these questions, the dashboard includes:

 - KPI cards (Total Orders, Units Sold, Total Sales)

- Time series chart for monthly sales trends

- Donut charts showing breakdowns by payment status and method

- Bar charts for product-wise sales

- A matrix for country-wise market performance

#### Key Insights
- Total Sales: The business generated over $36.35M in sales, with 81.29K units sold across 27K orders.

- Top Performing Product: Laptops led sales at $16M, followed by Smartphones ($11M).

- Monthly Trends: Sales peaked in April and August, while the lowest point was February.

- Market Leader: Australia contributed the highest revenue at $3.67M, followed by USA and India.

- Payment Method Preference: Credit Card was the most used method (33.78%), closely followed by PayPal (33.20%).

- Payment Status: Sales were almost evenly split among Completed (33.74%), Pending (33.52%), and Failed (32.74%), indicating potential issues in transaction completion.

#### Business Impact
- This dashboard offers actionable insights for ecommerce managers, helping to:

- Focus marketing efforts on high-performing products and regions.

- Improve customer experience by resolving payment completion issues.

- Forecast inventory needs by understanding sales patterns over the year.

- Tailor sales strategies based on consumer behavior in different countries.

#### Conclusion
The Ecommerce Sales Dashboard empowers business users with a clear, data-driven view of performance metrics. It transforms raw sales data into meaningful insights, enabling strategic decision-making. By identifying top-selling products, customer preferences, and sales dynamics across time and geography, the dashboard serves as a powerful tool for growth and optimization in the competitive ecommerce space.
